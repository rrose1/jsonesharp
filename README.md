## Overview

js1# is a browser-based implementation of the [1# text register
machine](http://www.indiana.edu/~iulg/trm/) used in Larry Moss's recursion
theory classes. The 1# interpreter is written in Javascript (with
jQuery/Bootstrap) and runs locally, so the whole package can work without
connectivity. The goal is simply to build an accessible and easy-to-use tool for
students working on the exercises that involve writing 1# programs.

You can try the build [here](http://rrose1.github.io/jsonesharp/).

## How to contribute

Anyone is encouraged to contribute and improve this thing. (Especially students
in the recursion theory course...maybe look at it as giving something back.)
Even if you're not inclined to work on the code, please feel free to write about
bugs, areas for improvement and desirable new features in the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/dasprunger/jsonesharp/issues).
